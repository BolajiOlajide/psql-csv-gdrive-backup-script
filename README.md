# PSQL-CSV-GDRIVE-BACKUP-SCRIPT

My attempt at automating the current process for backing up the Postgres DB for an internal app.

Currently, I have to manually export monthly records to a `.csv` and upload them to a google drive. That's becoming boring because I'm not getting any younger lol.

Hope I succeed 🤞🏽
